                        <p class="card-text">In 1909 Georgia, teenager Celie Harris lives with her sister Nettie and abusive father Alfonso. After her mother died, Alfonso started raping Celie, causing her to become pregnant twice. When Celie gives birth to her second child, Adam, Alfonso takes the child away as he had the first, Olivia. He then forces her to marry a local farmer and father of three, Albert "Mister" Johnson.

                            When Alfonso tries to molest Nettie, she moves into Mister's farmhouse, but when Nettie rebuffs his sexual advances he banishes her from his land; as she leaves, she promises to write to Celie every day. By 1917, Celie is still married to Mister. His son Harpo marries fierce, defiant Sofia, and builds a house for her. Celie befriends Sofia, but in a moment of jealousy advises Harpo to beat Sofia. Sofia leaves Harpo as a result, and he converts the house into a juke joint.
                            
                            Independent jazz singer Shug Avery, Mister's longtime lover, comes to town to perform at the joint and stays at Mister's house for a few days. Around the time, Mister's equally abusive father visits. Harpo has been seeing another woman, who he calls "Squeak". When he tries to dance with Sofia, Squeak cuts in and ends up starting a fight that trashes the joint. Escaping the brawl, Shug takes Celie to see a movie; the two kiss at the movie theatre and sleep together that night. In the morning, Shug picks up Mister's mail and finds a letter to Celie from Nettie; the two search the house and discover dozens of other letters from Nettie that Mister hid from Celie. The letters reveal that Nettie has been living in Africa and caring for Adam and Olivia, who were adopted by missionaries.
                            
                            In 1930, the mayor's wife condescendingly offers Sofia a job as her maid; when Sofia refuses she gets involved in a physical fight, resulting in her arrest. She is released after six years and ends up having to work for the mayor's wife anyway, sinking into a deep depression that seemingly takes away all of her fierceness.
                            
                            On Easter Sunday in 1943, when Shug and her new husband Grady are visiting, Celie confronts Mister in front of his father and their family. She leaves him and moves to Memphis with Shug. Squeak, whose real name is Mary Agnes, goes with them, inspiring Sofia out of her stupor. Celie vows to Mister that until he does right by her, everything in his life will crumble.
                            
                            In 1945, when Alfonso dies, his wife reveals to Celie that he was not Celie or Nettie's biological father, and the sisters now own the grocery store and the home they were brought up in. Celie moves back to Georgia and becomes a tailor, selling pants in the former grocery store. Meanwhile, Mister has become a miserable drunk. He vows to do right by Celie and plots to reunite Celie and Nettie, selling some of his land to pay for Nettie to return from Africa. Later he visits her shop and buys a pair of pants; while she is hesitant to see him, she agrees to maintain a friendship with him.</p>
